2. To call it from your code, just call 

```java 
// creation update of the dataset
Data7 dataset = updateOrCreateDatasetFor(CProjects.WIRESHARK);
BugCollector collector = new BugCollector(dataset);
BugDataset bdataset = collector.updateOrCreateBugDataset();
Utils.saveBugDataset(bdataset);

//simply loading a dataset
Utils.loadBugDataset(CProjects.WIRESHARK.getName());

```
